Entry into the [PubNub 2014 Competition](http://pubnubgame.challengepost.com/submissions/28062-robot-onslaught) by Thomas Hunter.

## Play The Game

Visit [thomashunter.name/games/robot-onslaught](https://thomashunter.name/games/robot-onslaught/) using a modern web browser.

I've only tested this in Chrome and Firefox.

Use WASD to move and the ARROW keys to shoot. Pro Tip: Map these to a gamepad ;)

## Code Quality

I learned Phaser and wrote this from scratch over the course of 10 hours, so the code is a bit ugly.
